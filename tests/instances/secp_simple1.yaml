#Smart environment configuration problem
objective: min
description: This is a very simple dcop modelling an secp with 3 light bulbs,
             1 models and one rule.

#pydcop -v 0 -t 3 solve -a dsa -d adhoc ./tests/instances/secp_simple1.yaml

domains:
  luminosity:
    values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    type: 'luminosity'

variables:
# l1, l2 and l3 represent the 3 light bulb. They each have a different
# efficiency (from their cost function), l3 being the most efficient and l1
# the less efficient
  l1:
    domain: luminosity
    cost_function: 0.7 * l1
  l2:
    domain: luminosity
    cost_function: 0.5 * l2
  l3:
    domain: luminosity
    cost_function: 0.2 * l3

# m1 is the variable associated to the physical model that depends on l1, l2
 # and l2
  m1:
    domain: luminosity


constraints:
# m1_c is the contraint that bind the light bulb to the physical model
# variable m1
  m1_c:
    type: intention
    function: 0 if m1 == round(0.7 * l1 + 0.5 * l2 + 0.3 * l3) else 1000
# r1 is the constraint model the user rule: the target is to have a
# luminosity of 3 for the physical model and 2 for l2
  r1:
    type: intention
    function: 10 * (abs(m1 - 3) + abs(l2 -3))

agents:
# We have three agents one for each light bulb.
# The capacity is selected to make sure that all free computation cannot fit
# on one single agent.
  al1:
    capacity: 100
  al2:
    capacity: 100
  al3:
    capacity: 100

distribution_hints:
# For an secp, we have the additional constraint of hosting each light
# variable on the agent of the corresponding light bulb.
  must_host:
    al1: [l1]
    al2: [l2]
    al3: [l3]
